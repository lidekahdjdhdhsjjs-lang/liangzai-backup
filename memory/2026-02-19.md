# 2026-02-19 Daily Notes

## 🔧 System Diagnosis (2026-02-19 00:11)

### Issues Identified:

1. **Browser Not Connected (Known Issue)**
   - Status: Browser service configured but not running
   - Cause: Chrome Relay requires manual connection via toolbar extension
   - Expected behavior when not manually attached
   - Workaround: Use web_search + exec instead of browser tool

2. **Exec Command Failures (Historical)**
   - Count: ~19x occurrences (mostly expected failures)
   - Root causes:
     - Missing files (ENOENT) - e.g., today's memory file
     - Web fetch 404s - external URL changes
     - Edit multi-match - precision issues
   - No actual "exit code N" critical failures found

3. **Message Tool (1 failure)**
   - Missing channel parameter when multiple channels configured
   - Fix: Always specify target channel explicitly

4. **Read Tool Issues**
   - Offset beyond file length - logic error
   - Missing files - expected for future dates

### Actions Taken:

- ✅ Created today's memory file (2026-02-19.md)
- ✅ Verified Gateway running normally
- ✅ Verified most cron jobs healthy (28 jobs, most with OK status)

### Recommendations:

1. **Browser**: Add hook to remind user when browser needed but not connected
2. **Memory**: Auto-create daily memory file at session start
3. **Web Fetch**: Add graceful 404 handling with fallback
4. **Message**: Add channel validation before sending

### 🔄 Follow-up Diagnosis (2026-02-19 02:06)

**System Update:**
- ✅ Gateway restarted successfully (PID: 1066111)
- ✅ Hook `auto-memory-creator` loaded and active
- ✅ Most cron jobs running with OK status
- ⚠️ 1 job with delivery notification issue (non-critical): `self-evolution-code`

**Current Status:**
- Gateway: ✅ Running normally
- Cron Jobs: 28 total, 27 healthy, 1 delivery issue (self-evolution-code)
- Patterns: 164 crystallized
- "Exec command exits": 25 total (mostly expected - 404s, missing files)

**Conclusion:** System healthy. No critical issues. Recurring failures are known/expected behavior.
