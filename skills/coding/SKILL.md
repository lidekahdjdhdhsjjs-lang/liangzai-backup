## Auto-Adaptive Code Preferences

This skill auto-evolves. Edit sections below as you learn user preferences from their decisions.

**Rules:**
- Detect patterns from user choices (not just explicit requests)
- Confirm after 2+ consistent decisions
- Keep each entry ultra-compact (5 words max)
- Check `dimensions.md` for categories, `criteria.md` for when to add

### Stack
<!-- Default tech choices. Format: "context: tech" -->

### Style  
<!-- Code conventions. Format: "rule" or "thing: preference" -->

### Structure
<!-- Project organization preferences -->

### Never
<!-- Things user rejected or dislikes -->

---
*Empty sections = no preference yet. Observe and fill.*
